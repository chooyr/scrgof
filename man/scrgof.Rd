\title{
	Goodness-of-Fit Tests For Spatial Capture-Recapture
}
\description{
	Tests goodness-of-fit for SECR models, using Monte Carlo resampling methods to obtain the empirical distributions of fit statistics conditioned on realised activity centres.
}
\usage{
scrgof(object, nsamp = 1000, maxperpoly = 100, renumber = FALSE)
}
%- maybe also 'usage' for other objects documented here.
\arguments{
  \item{object}{
		a fitted SECR model
}
  \item{nsamp}{
		number of Monte Carlo resamples to be drawn from the model
}
}
\details{
	{scrgof} calculates fit using summary statistics suggested in Royle et al. (2014).
	FT-ind-trap is a fit statistic based on the number of encounters of each individual at each trap.  FT-individuals is based on the total encounters of each individual. FT-traps is based on the total encounters at each trap.  These summary statistics are conditioned on the predicted activity centre locations of observed and hypothetical animals in the population.  Fit statistics are then calculated from the summary statistics in the form of Freeman-Tukey statistics: \eqn{FT-stat = \displaystyle\sum\limits_{n=1}^{N} \left(\displaystyle\sqrt{O_n} - \displaystyle\sqrt{E_n} )^2}.  The uncertainty of the model parameters and the activity centre locations are propagated to the fit statistics using Monte Carlo resampling methods.
	
	{scrgof} is also a wrapper for {secr::sim.detect}, which is used to calculate expected values and simulate new capture histories when resampling from the fitted model, and is subjected to the same limitations i.e. modles fitted using conditional likelihood, telemetry models and exotic behavioural response models.
